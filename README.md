# CPDoom
A doom source port for the Classpad II (fx-CP400).

## Installation
Download the [latest .zip file](https://github.com/diddyholz/CPDoom/releases) and extract it into the root directory of your calculator. Your directory structure should then be as follows:
```
├── run.bin (Hollyhock launcher)
├── CPDoom.bin (Main CPDoom executable)
└── CPDoom/
    └── wad/
        ├── doom1.wad (The included shareware version of doom)
        └── ** Put other wads in here **
``` 

## Using other wads
To use other wads (such as a legaly acquired registered version), add them to the `/CPDoom/wad/` directory and rename your other wads to something like `doom1.wad.bak` so they do not get loaded.

Doom will search for wads in this order and selects the first it finds:

| Filename     | Game Version      |
|--------------|-------------------|
| doom2f.wad   | Doom 2 (French)   |
| doom2.wad    | Doom 2            |
| plutonia.wad | Plutonia          |
| tnt.wad      | TNT: Evilution    |
| doomu.wad    | Ultimate Doom     |
| doom.wad     | Doom (Registered) |
| doom1.wad    | Doom (Shareware)  |
